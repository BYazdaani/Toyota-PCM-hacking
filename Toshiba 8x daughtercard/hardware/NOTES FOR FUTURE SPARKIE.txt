Because past sparkie is still a lazy dick
=======================================



micro remains powered and in reset while the car is off

FT245 is powered from PCM, stays in reset (bus highZ) while not connected to usb

may need additional 10V 100uf cap to extend leads and fold down c507 on pcm logic board to make daughtercard fit.

cant get ASL part in 1504, only 1508. added power down input, not implemented in cupl, may be fitter option.
	-i seem to recall powerdown didnt work well, switch to high efficiency version of chip which uses no real current while static.

PBCS functionality may need to be emulated as well.

from testing
=============
need resistor on usb power feed to avoid backdriving ftdi when unpowered (makes mucho heat!)

Capcitor for filtering FTDI reset line so short jiggles dont reset FTDI

pull xx resistors for FTDI status lines

forgot to string power along to flash pullups

test points, attachments for serial ports on micro

pin 10 is /IDL, plumb it out to cpld and update cpld layout to fit.
