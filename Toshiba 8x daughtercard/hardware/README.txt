SW1 is a 4 bit rotary encoder to select different code bases for the CPU (I kept two copies of the bootloader just in case)

The FT245 is gods gift to retroembedded - bus to usb-serial! Bang in 8 bits and it's sent to your PC that was built in the last decade. Plus it's got MASSIVE FIFOs. USB data logging on your 88MR2? you betcha.

there's a bug here I think, I recall haveing to add a bodge wire. will confirm

Pictures of the installed and running unit will be coming soon.
